djvupages
=========

A tool to (finally!) extract an arbitrary set of pages from a djvu file and merge them in another file.

Basically, it is a wrapper for djvulibre, since all the functionality is already implemented, but in an obscure way.
Therefore, the tool requires djvulibre (and bash :), and is licenced under GPLv2.
